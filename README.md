# KlopapierApp
This is an **open sourced** Toiletpaper Finder Android App for Germany. This app is based on [this repository](https://gist.github.com/marco79cgn/23ce08fd8711ee893a3be12d4543f2d2 "dm-toilet-paper.js") written by [@marco79cgn](https://gist.github.com/marco79cgn). The dm stores list displays all (if I didn't miss any) dm Stores in Cologne, Germany. If you don't see your dm Store on the list you can still search for any dm store.

**Key features**
* Realtime stock of toilet paper in DM stores.
* Filter the DM stores list to show nearest first
* Clicking on the address of a store will redirect you to the GoogleMaps
* Search function for your nearest DM using it's Shop ID

# Installation

This App is not, and probably will never be on Google's PlayStore (I know.. I'm sorry), but you can still install this app by following these steps:
* Download the apk from [this](https://github.com/AndresAnariba/KlopapierApp/blob/master/app-debug.apk) url from your mobile device (in this example I will be using my Google Chrome webbrowser)
* Click Open on the bottom tab
* Android Phones can only install apps from the PlayStore by default. Luckily we can change this, so click Settings on the tab that was recently opened.
* Enable Google Chrome to install apps
* Click install
* ... wait for it...
* Click open
* Enjoy :)

# Acknowledgements

Special thanks to [@marco79cgn](https://gist.github.com/marco79cgn) who had this great idea, kept his code open sourced, and took the time to search for the DANS of the toilet paper items!

# Disclaimer

As @marco79cgn said it, this is a project that was developed with the sole purpose of having fun, this is **NOT** an official Product from DM, it is not sponsored by anyone, and since it is not intended to generate money, it is and will remain open sourced. I do not own the dm API nor any information or pictures displayed on the app.

Also, really important, I do **NOT** hope that people start bulk buying toilet paper again! This should be just a reference for people to know there's enough toilet paper for all of us ðŸ˜….
